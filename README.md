# RANDOM QUOTE GENERATOR

I am learning React, so I built a random quote generator to practice what I have learned so far. This project utilizes two React hooks, `useState` and `useEffect`, to manage state and handle side effects. The quotes are fetched from the Advice Slip API.

## Features

- Generates random quotes from the Advice Slip API.
- Updates the quote automatically every time the page is loaded or refreshed.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
